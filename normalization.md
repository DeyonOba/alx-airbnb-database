# Database Normalization

Why do we need to normalize the `air_bnb_clone` database?
Normalization helps to reduce data redundancy, maintain data integrity, and prevents insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. Some times bad data is a result of bad database design, therefore checks must be set to prevent poor database design this checks are known as normal forms. In construction companies we have standard for making builds and this standards stands as a guardrail for safety, and consitency, the same way we have this normal formals to verify if a database design is optimum, and properly designed.

In summary normalized database are:
- Easier to understand
- Easier to enhance and optimize
- Protected for update, insertion, and deletion anomaly
